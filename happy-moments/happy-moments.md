# Happy Moments

### One happy moment per day (top is most recent), so by the end of the year, I'll have 365 happy moments to look back on ^_^

In my case, this was transformed into a _gratitude journal_. I carry a small [Field Notes notebook](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/shop/) with me, where I write my daily highlights. Around three items per day, but such number varies according to the quality of the day.
