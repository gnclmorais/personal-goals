Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning. Learn more about the original project by [Una Kravets](https://github.com/una) [here](http://una.im/personal-goals-guide/). Her [talk at 2015’s BeyondConf](http://2015.beyondconf.co/schedule/#anchor-una) brought this project to my attention.
