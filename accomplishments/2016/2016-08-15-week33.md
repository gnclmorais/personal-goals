### Musical highlight
On the 33rd week of 2016, my favourite musical pick was [Suburban Kids With Biblical Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburban_Kids_with_Biblical_Names) with [Rent a wreck](https://open.spotify.com/track/439masidPgeLjLwo5IYlSU).

### Week in Review
Relaxed week where work was OK and physical activity was plenty. Godspeed You! Black Emperor’s concert was pretty cool, but the venue was too old and hot, quite uncomfortable. Although homey, the weekend was pleasant and productive, with some considerable breakthroughs on Myūzu! Finally, I had one more pairing session with my mentee and cooked for hours. :D
