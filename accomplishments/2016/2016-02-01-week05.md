### Week in Review
It started in a heavy way, but releasing a big feature on my job took a big weight out of my shoulders. I didn’t do much coding on side projects and I didn’t even finish my 100:10:1… But I’m learning not to put too much pressure on me. These things need to be a bit more organic, and I need to get more motivated about them, in order to be more willing to work on them. I believe this will improve over time, as I take all these annoying tasks (like schedule trips) out of my way.
