### Week in Review
Finally getting back to my normal schedule and routine. I’m cooking again and back to running, so everything it back on track. Now I just need to (re)start waking up early to work on side projects. I even had some time to take photos around Brick Lane, so that was nice.
On another note, internet on my apartment has been so unreliable I spend most of the weekend on coffeeshops. I hope this gets solved soon…
