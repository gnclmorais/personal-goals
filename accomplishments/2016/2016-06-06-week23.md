### Week in Review
I didn’t have a lot of time to work on side projects, but at least it was full of social activity. The last meetup with Francesco was pretty cool, I’ll do my best to keep organising them. Primavera Sound was great, even though it was the weakest day of the three (Sensible Soccers concert was amazing!). Finally, running into so many old friend in Susana’s wedding just closed this week in a golden note! It was great to have them all there, specially Dora.

P.S.: I assume I go back to London… because I’m writing this review in the airport, with the flight delayed by 2 hours (at least). *sigh*…
