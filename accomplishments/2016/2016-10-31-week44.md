## Next Week's Focus:

### Week in Review
It was a shame to miss the regular run on Tuesday, but it was for a good cause… I’ve been trying to see James Blake for a few years now. It was actually a week full of concerts, and luckily I had good company for one of them.
The weekend was great and the longrun on Sunday was not exactly easy, but I was already expecting that.
