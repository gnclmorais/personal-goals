## Next Week's Focus: Plan and start 2017

### Week in Review:
Work was slow but productive. It was great to have the office (mostly) for my own, but it was also great to work from home.
The highlight would be probably New Year’s Eve, which was the most fun I have probably had. Fun and productive, something I love. But now, time to make plans for 2017…
