### Week in Review
Although not the most productive yet, it was full of good stuff. I published some writing, I submitted a talk (and got good feedback about the other ones), I ran almost 25km (yeah, I messed up my lap count, and ended up running an extra lap ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯), and I met more [Recursers](https://recurse.com)!

Besides this, one of my best friends came up with a great realisation, something that have been helping me fighting the ever-present [FoMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out). Everything that we do in a single day is already __so much__… Work 8 hours a day, run a few kilometers, read dozens of pages about Philosophy, Science, Psychology, cook most of our meals, read a couple of books, write about life, trips, and once in a while we also work on side projects. After reading all of this, I found myself at ease, thinking that maybe we’re not so worthless as I thought.
