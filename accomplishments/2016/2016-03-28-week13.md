### Week in Review
Working remotely from my house was a challenge; not related to productivity, but making my family understand how it worked. Luckily, I had the new albums from Explosion In The Sky and [Moderat](https://open.spotify.com/album/7BmMOUo8nrmYHB2EHBGkSt).
I’m also concerned about my god-daughter, I must check what’s happening.
Working on side project was almost impossible, since any time I wasn’t working remotely, I had to hang out with my family. Luckily, I was able to play a couple of hours of Torchlight II, a game I really missed.
