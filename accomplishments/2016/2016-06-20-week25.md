### Week in Review
The 10K was harder than I thought, although I’m happy with the result. I guess my physical form is still not there yet. I need to keep doing the weekend long runs.
DakhaBrakha concert was amazing, I’m sure I’ll do it again when I have the chance.
I worked a lot on my new theme and it’s coming along really cool!
