### Musical highlight
Starting from this week, I’m starting to add the best new music I came across during that week. On the 3rd week of 2016, my favourite musical pick was [Gui Boratto](https://www.facebook.com/guiboratto/) with [Chromophobia](https://open.spotify.com/album/4YGAJpc1fylGTq0Vr2CBYI).

### Week in Review
Went pretty well, it was very social. Luckily, Sunday was very productive and chilled and filled with coffee. ☕️  
I’ve noticed that I’m cramming too many tasks per week on my Trello board, which basically forces me to start pushing them from one week to another, something I’m looking to avoid. I’ll start paying attention to this.
