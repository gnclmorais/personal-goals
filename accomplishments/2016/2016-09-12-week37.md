### Musical highlight
On the 37th week of 2016, my favourite musical pick was [Local Natives](https://www.facebook.com/localnatives/) with [Sunlit Youth](https://open.spotify.com/album/6cw3MldDCO3heDYTRoX2DN). However, I’m quite disappointed with the album, I feel they lost their characteristic sound.

## Next Week's Focus: Get back to routine productivity

### Week in Review
Simply amazing and unique. Erisa inviting me to her wedding was special and a singular experience, I was able to see a good part of a country I never thought of visiting. It was a good introduction to the Balkans, and now I can’t wait to visit more of it…!
