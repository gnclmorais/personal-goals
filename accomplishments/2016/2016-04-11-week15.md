### Week in Review
I finally appreciate having a living room. It was fun to play board games but I just noticed how awful Catan can be. I wasn’t able to work that much on side projects, which is something that I’ve been seeing a lot. Maybe I should look for other people and see how they fit their projects into their own lives & jobs.
