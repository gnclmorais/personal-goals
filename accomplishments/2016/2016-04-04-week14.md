### Week in Review
Having Serena here was great and super fun, but it totally threw my routine out of the window. I haven’t been able to settle down since I moved houses, but I believe I’ll be able to do it this week.
Releasing a first version of RATW has been more painful than I thought… I still need to review the first interview and tweak some styling for titles, paragraphs and the like.
