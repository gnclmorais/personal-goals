### Week in Review
It was a pretty good week, quite productive. I can’t make all the progress I would like to on side projects, since I can only crack on them part-time.
I ditched [Dan Deacon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuJqUvBj4rE&hd=1)’s concert and I don’t regret. I was not well that day. What I regret was going all the way to Camden, just to get there and see that [Birdeatbaby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQh4I_sPeNc&hd=1) were not playing. I have no idea what happened there.
It was great to be at the Canvas with Recursers, I like that bunch.
Got a few _no’s_ from ScotlandCSS and ScotlandJS… Oh well.
