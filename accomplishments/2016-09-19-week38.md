### Musical highlight
On the 38th week of 2016, my favourite musical pick was [Bruno Pernadas](https://www.facebook.com/brunopernadaspage) with [Those Who Throw Objects at the Crocodiles Will Be Asked to Retrieve Them](https://open.spotify.com/album/2NYnAb4TkXGHrY8wZ9uZwT). Warpaint’s new album is not bad as well.

## Next Week's Focus: Balance several different activities

### Week in Review
Professional, everything is already. Still learning Rails, bit by bit.
Personally, it was great have Carlos here, he’s the best! On another note, people I meet in Midnight Runners are great, specially M.
