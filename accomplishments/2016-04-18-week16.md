### Week in Review
Great week, with old friends around and new friends on the horizon. I had a fun Magic: The Gathering draft, and an even better conference in Oxford. Then I came back to London and had an epic concert and a immersive cinema experience. It was the best, even though I didn’t have a lot of time for side projects.
