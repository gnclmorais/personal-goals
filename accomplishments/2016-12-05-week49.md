### Week in Review:
Once more I’m doing a late review, so I don’t remember a lot… But I remember giving my first tech was nerve-wracking but incredibly exciting! It was a great experience, can’t wait to see the video!
The rest of the week was work and spending time with M, since I’m spending two weeks in Portugal.
Sunday was cool, had to give a speech at my mom’s birthday, I think she liked it.
