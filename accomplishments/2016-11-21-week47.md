### Week in Review:
I hope this is not becoming a habit, but this review is coming late again.
This was a full week, with a lot of meets and activities! The typical run with my crew, my first Thanksgiving, the Matrix run on Friday!
The weekend was non-techy at all, since I’ll be out of London for the next three or four weekends. There was brunch at TRADE, craft beer, a birthday dinner, and a lovely trip to Kew Garden (at night, to see the lights). This was a good week…
Oh! Best thing this week, and one of the best of the year: I was selected to talk at dotJS next next Monday…! EXCITED!
