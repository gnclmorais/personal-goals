## Next Week's Focus: Get some work done despite busy week

### Week in Review
Pretty chilled, not a lot of events, so I was able to [do something](https://github.com/gnclmorais/holy-ward-slack), however silly. There were a couple important birthdays for me this week; one of them was a bit sad — but what was I expecting, anyway?
Weekend was good, quite productive. Had a long, 21k run; specially painful because it was too hot. Paired a bit with my mentee, and then spent a few hours cooking for the whole week!
