### Week in Review
Leaving London behind felt specially great. Not having my routine is a minus, but it also makes me feel fortunate, thinking where I am at the moment and the people I have around me. It also took a toll on my work & projects, but _hey_, this is vacation, so I should relax a bit more and just enjoy it. Next week I’ll be working remotely, so I’ll definitely have some kind of routine.
