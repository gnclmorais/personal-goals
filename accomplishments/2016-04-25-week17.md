### Week in Review
This week went by really fast. Work was fine; even though JS is not as common as I wish it to be, we are building & releasing important features nevertheless. Had two really cool concerts, and the [Gaki no Tsukai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y14tQNfxpa4) marathon was simply hilarious! I also worked quite a bit on RATW and everything is really close to be released, which makes me really happy. I hope to get good feedback on it!
I finally bought some bouldering shoes and registered on the nearby centre. Also, had the first Hangout with my mentee, let’s see where this goes. Now I need to come up with a good progress plan.
