### Week in Review
It went pretty fast, and luckily we had a bank holiday. I also moved houses, which took a while but it was almost perfectly timed. Working on RATW was really productive; not code wise, but more Jekyll and Ruby wise. I’m happy I got to come home for Easter, it was pleasant. However, I never miss home as most people do. I guess I just spent too many years in here.
