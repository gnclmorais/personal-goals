### Week in Review
Myuzu is starting strong, as I mix technologies I have never mixed before.
Seeing friends I haven’t seen in a while is great, and this week I met with three of them, which was great.
Having a mentee is great, the few hours we work on something together seem solid and I can feel her progress
This week I realised I don’t know exactly where to go or what to do to progress, professionally. Building web things doesn’t seem to be enough… At least, not the way I have been doing. I must find another way.
