### Week in Review:
The workweek was pretty standard, with the typical work and Midnight Runners 10k. The highlight was traveling to Paris, where I had my first technical talk. It was simply a 4-minute lightning talk, true… but it was my first talk in a conference and in front of more than 1000 people! I believe it went great, so I couldn’t be happier. It was also my first time in Paris and I even went to a concert of a great artist. Top marks for this week, I was able to scratch a few things from my bucket list.
