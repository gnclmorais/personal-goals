On the 35th week of 2016, my favourite musical pick was [The Divine Comedy](https://www.facebook.com/divinecomedyhq/) with [Foreverland](https://open.spotify.com/album/2GAk30u0kW148QWQVo2vSn). It was a great concert, although short.

### Week in Review
The week started in a great way, having Monday as a bank holiday and coming from Amsterdam. Besides my job, I was able to work a bit on side projects; but I still wonder how the great developers I follow on Twitter can be so prolific. I don’t believe it’s possible to work 40 hours a week, have a really healthy lifestyle (with healthy home cooked meals and 4-6 sessions of exercise per week), __and__ make good progress on side projects. Don’t forget also keeping in touch with friends and actually getting out of the house in the weekends (at least). Maybe one day I’ll figure it out how (I feel a 4-day workweek would work).
